Introduction

`GeoNIS <http://geonis.lternet.edu>`_ is a web service that processes, stores, and displays geospatial data collected by the `Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTER) <http://www.lternet.edu/>`_, as part of the `Network Information System <https://nis.lternet.edu/>`_. GeoNIS searches for and downloads spatial data from the `Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture <https://portal.lternet.edu/nis/home.jsp>`_. Using an ArcGIS Python-based workflow, GeoNIS then processes this spatial data, and makes them available via ArcGIS map and image REST services. An integrated web map, with toggleable vector and raster layers, is included for each LTER site. Detailed GeoNIS reports are also available for each data package.
